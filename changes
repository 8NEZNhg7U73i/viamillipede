Bugs:
	Fix deadlock!: Increase buffersize socket options; small buffers on single machines might deadlock due to one binary exhausting all TCP buffers. 
Performance:
	Use writev for tx sock operations
Observatiblity:
	Add SIGINFO reports for RX, compact and sanitize the status reports
	Add delayus operator for slowing connection.
	SIGUSR1 and SIGUSER2 now increment and decrement verbose levels.
Smoke tests rewritten (to pass)
	- use openssl for repeatable pseudorandom, unsalted, extra chunky data.
